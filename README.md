# MediaDownloader

MediaDownloader is a cross-platform java app which allows you to download files from YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, StreamCloud, SoundCloud and much more sites (way more will be added in the future).

There is also a Regular-Expression AddOn which allows you to search the website for example: URLs of any type.

Check out an online version of my YouTube Downloader (also unlocks GEMA blocked videos in Germany): http://youtube.r3d-soft.de
